# Flat Incognito Dark Theme

Updated for the new Chrome redesign! Please update to Chrome v69 for full compatibility with this theme. 

Incognito mode currently uses a dark colour scheme to distinguish it from normal mode. This theme imitates that colour scheme and applies it throughout the whole browser.

### Installation
Install the theme from the Chrome Web Store [here]

### Limitations
Chrome theme devs currently have no ability to colour the omnibox. As a result, the omnibox will always be white.
